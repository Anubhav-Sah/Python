#7. Bitwise Operators


#*************************Arithmetic Operators*************************
#Arithmetic Operators are used to perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division etc. 
# Addition Operator -> "+" -> 15+4
# Substraction Operator -> "-" -> 15-4
# Multiplication Operator -> "*" -> 15*4
# Division Operator -> "/" -> 15/4
# Modulus Operator -> "%" -> 15%4
# Float Division -> "//" -> 15//4
# Exponentiation Operator -> "**" -> 15**4

print("Addition",15+4)
print("Substraction",15-4)
print("Multiplication",15*4)
print("Division",5/3)
print("Remainder",5%3)
print("Exponent",15**4)
print("Exponent",5//3)
