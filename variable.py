# In python all datatype is an object

#*****************Variable*****************

#we can define variable in python just by using name 
#syntax is " var_name = value "
#we can assign any data type to variable
#we can assign any value to variable

#*****************type()*****************

#if we want to check the datatype of the variable then we can use type() function in python
#type() function returns the data type of the variable
#we can use print() function to print the value of the variable



#*****************datatype*****************

#Numeric data : int, float,complex
#   @ int: 3,-8,0
#   @ float: 3.14,-8.9,0.0
#   @ complex: 3+4j,-8-9j,0+0j

#Text data:str
#   @ str:"Hello wold",'a'


#Boolean data: 
#   @ Boolean data consists of value True and false


# Sequence data : list, tuple
#   @ list: [1,2,3],[1,2,3,4,5]
#   A list is an ordered collection of data with element seperated by a comma and enclosed within square brackets[].List are mutable and can be modified after creation

list1 = [8,2.3,[4,3],["apple","banana"]]
print(list1)

print (type (list1))


#   @ tuple: (1,2,3),(1,2,3,4,5)
#   A tuple is an ordered collection of data with element seperated by a comma and enclosed within parentheses.Tuples are immutable and can not be modified after creation

tuple1 = ("Hello",(1,3),"ANUBHAV") 
print(tuple1)

# Mapped data : dict
#   @ dict: {"name":"anubhav","age":20}
#   @ A dictionary is an unordered collection of data cointaining a key: value pairs enclosed within curly brackets{}.Dictionaries are mutable and can be modified after creation
